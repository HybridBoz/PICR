# Picr

Self-hosted online image sharing tool for photographers to share photos with clients.

I built this because:
- Google Drive charges too much for storage
- I want the ability to log visits (IE: see when clients accessed photos)
- Have star ratings or thumbs up/down from clients which I can export (as 'selects' for example)

Goals:
- Single node based container that can deploy to any device, specifically targeting good performance on Synology NAS
- Easy to set up and use by my photographer friends who aren't familiar with docker/compose/etc
